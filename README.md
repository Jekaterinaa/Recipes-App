## Project Overview

The AI Recipe Generator is a full-stack web application that helps users discover new recipes by simply uploading a photo of their available ingredients. The application leverages AI technologies to provide an intuitive and personalized cooking experience.

## Application Flow

1. **Landing Page** - Welcome screen with project introduction
2. **Image Upload** - Users upload photos of their ingredients/fridge
3. **Ingredient Detection** - AI analyzes the image and extracts ingredient list, user can adjust the list by adding/removing ingredients
4. **Preference Form** - Users specify dietary restrictions and preferences and number of recipes to generate
5. **Recipe Generation** - AI creates personalized recipes
6. **Image Generation** - AI generates images for each recipe
7. **Recipe Selection** - Generated recipe options displayed to users
8. **Recipe Details** - Full recipe view with ingredients and detailed instructions

## Core Features

### üîç **Intelligent Ingredient Detection**
- Upload photos of ingredients from your kitchen/fridge
- AI-powered computer vision automatically identifies and lists ingredients
- Manual editing capabilities to add, or remove detected ingredients
- Smart ingredient cleaning and validation

### üç≥ **Personalized Recipe Generation**
- Generate 1-3 custom recipes based on detected ingredients
- Comprehensive preference customization including:
  - Food allergies (Nuts, Eggs, Fish, Soy, Honey, etc.)
  - Dietary restrictions (Vegetarian, Vegan, Keto, Halal, Kosher, etc.)
  - Ingredients to avoid (Lactose, Gluten, Sugar, Spicy food)
  - Cuisine preferences (Asian, European, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern)

### üé® **AI-Generated Recipe Images**
- Automatically generated images for each recipe
- Visual recipe representation to help with meal selection
- Base64-encoded images for fast loading and display

### üìñ **Detailed Recipe Information**
- Complete ingredient list
- Short recipe description
- Step-by-step cooking instructions
- Estimated cooking time

### üéØ **Interactive User Experience**
- Modern, responsive web interface with smooth animations
- Multi-step workflow with intuitive navigation
- Real-time feedback and loading states

## AI Integration

The application uses OpenAI's GPT-4 model with structured outputs to ensure reliable and consistent responses. The AI pipeline includes:

- **Image Analysis** - Vision-language model processes ingredient photos
- **Ingredient Validation** - Cleans and standardizes detected ingredients
- **Recipe Creation** - Generates creative, culturally-appropriate recipes
- **Image Generation** - Creates appealing visual representations
